GitHub - Task list completed PR check
=========================

Check a pull request body for task lists / checkboxes / tickboxes & make sure they are all completed.
The check will not pass until all task lists have been checked.

**Mark it as a required check to preventing merging the PR until all tasks in a PR have been ticked off.**

You can use this to check manual tests or requirements have been ticked off before the pull request can be merged.

E.g. Say you add some tasks like so
```
- [x] Check the size looks good on the front end
- [ ] Check the image is centered
```

& they display like this to be ticked off as tests:

![](./screenshots/example-pr.png)

this will show the check as pending as only 1 of the tasks is completed s (same if none etc.):

![](./screenshots/tasks-remaining.png)

Once all tasks are marked off it'll show as completed:

![](./screenshots/tasks-completed.png)


Also when viewing all Pull Requests, you'll see the green tick when all completed:
![](./screenshots/success-pr.png)

& an orange dot when still tasks todo:
![](./screenshots/pending-pr.png)

& if you have other CI tests such as unit tests etc, our pending status will not get in the way of failing tests, they will still show as the red cross:

## Docs

Install & add to the repos you want.

Want to require tasks to be complete before it can be merged?

Inside your GitHub repo > Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules > Add rule > select require checks & require this check to pass.

By default, we mark the check as in_progress until all tasks pass and then it marks it as successful.
